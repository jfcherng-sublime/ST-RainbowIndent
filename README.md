## FAQ

### How to Customize Indent Colors?

First, you have to decide how many colors you want to use for indents.

Say, if you want to use 6 colors, add the following into plugin's `level_colors` setting.

```js
"level_colors": [
    "region.indent.0",
    "region.indent.1",
    "region.indent.2",
    "region.indent.3",
    "region.indent.4",
    "region.indent.5",
],
```

These `region.indent.0` ... `region.indent.5` are called `scope`s in Sublime Text.
Names of `scope` aren't important but I just feel these names are self-explanatory.

Next, you have to add coloring rules into your color scheme for those `scope`s.
For example, adding the following rules into your color scheme.

- `foreground` is the indent line color when `level_style` is set to `line`.
- `background` is the indent background color when `level_style` is set to `block`.

Valid color formats are listed on [Sublime Text's official document][st-docs-color-schemes-colors].

```js
///////////////////
// RainbowIndent //
///////////////////
{
    // red
    "foreground": "rgba(229, 57, 53, 0.35)",
    "background": "rgba(229, 57, 53, 0.2)",
    "scope": "region.indent.0",
},
{
    // green
    "foreground": "rgba(67, 160, 71, 0.35)",
    "background": "rgba(67, 160, 71, 0.2)",
    "scope": "region.indent.1",
},
{
    // blue
    "foreground": "rgba(30, 136, 229, 0.35)",
    "background": "rgba(30, 136, 229, 0.2)",
    "scope": "region.indent.2",
},
{
    // orange
    "foreground": "rgba(251, 140, 0, 0.35)",
    "background": "rgba(251, 140, 0, 0.2)",
    "scope": "region.indent.3",
},
{
    // purple
    "foreground": "rgba(142, 36, 170, 0.35)",
    "background": "rgba(142, 36, 170, 0.2)",
    "scope": "region.indent.4",
},
{
    // cyan
    "foreground": "rgba(0, 172, 193, 0.35)",
    "background": "rgba(0, 172, 193, 0.2)",
    "scope": "region.indent.5",
},
```

### How to Disable Rendering by Default and Enable Manually?

You can set the `enabled_selector` plugin setting to `"nothing"`.
Because no scope is named `nothing`, the plugin won't render indents.

Then, you can enable rendering manually by one of the following ways.

- From the command palette: `RainbowIndent: Disable for This View (Forced)`
- From the context menu: `RainbowIndent` Â» `Disable for This View (Forced)`
- Create and trigger a keybinding for the `rainbow_indent_view_toggle` command for convenience.

## Known Issues

- There is no way to draw a region, where there is nothing, via ST's plugin APIs.
- Sometimes, ST seems to draw regions wrongly. Not sure how to stably reproduce this.
